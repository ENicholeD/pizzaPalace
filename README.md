This is an application that I made for my solo project at Epicodus.

## Description

This program is meant for the user to create a pizza. I made this for my 4th week at Epicodus to show my understanding of Objects.

## Specs

| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| picked toppings get stored into an array | "Pepperoni, Cheese, Anchovies" | ["pepperoni", "cheese", "anchovies"] |
| topping price is determined by the length of the array times 2 | array length is 3 | the overall price for the toppings is $6 |
| topping price and the base price are added together to get the pizza price | $7 + $6 | $13 |
| user adds another completed pizza to add to their checkout total | pizza1= $13, Pizza2 = $15 | The checkout price becomes $28 |
| user decides to remove the $15 pizza | user presses a button which is attached to the pizza's id and tells it that the user wants to delete it | the pizza is deleted and removed from the checkout price which becomes $13 |
| choose pickup to avoid getting the delivery fee | $0 | the total is still $13 |
| choose delivery and adds it to the total price | $28 + $4 | the new total is $17 |
| User adds their name address to display on their receipt  | "Fred Marcus", "1234 pizza st.", "notARealPlace", "fakeState", "54321" | "Fred Marcus of 1234 pizza st., notARealPlace fakeState 54321, your total is $17" |
