This is an application that I made for my solo project at Epicodus.

#### By Erin Deuel on 8/23/2019

## Description

This program is meant for the user to create a pizza. I made this for my 4th week at Epicodus to show my understanding of Objects.

## Specs

| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| picked pizza crust gives a base price | "Gluten Free" | $5 |
| sauce choice adds to the base price | "white sauce" | base price is now $7 |
| picked toppings get stored into an array | "Pepperoni, Cheese, Anchovies" | ["pepperoni", "cheese", "anchovies"] |
| topping price is determined by the length of the array times 2 | array length is 3 | the overall price for the toppings is $6 |
| topping price and the base price are added together to get the pizza price | $7 + $6 | $13 |
| user adds another completed pizza to add to their checkout total | pizza1= $13, Pizza2 = $15 | The checkout price becomes $28 |
